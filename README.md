What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
It helped me understand lighting when it comes to rendering a 3D scene mostly, that and understanding how to estimate the scale of things I suppose.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I looked through what was required of me and completed what was requested bit by bit as more and more things were requested. Other than that, most of my
design process was mostly looking at my reference for my scene and the rendering of it to compare what I was creating with the actual version of it.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
If I had to choose something, it would be the incremental development of things to eventually make a completed project, especially because of the order in which I made stuff, I could see working with other people on this at the same time being difficult if everyone isn't on the same page about measurements so if I were
to work with others on a team, I would recommend getting proper measurements of the scene before working on it or have very few people work on making the
objects.

How did iteration factor into your development?
I implemented features and 3D models over time as needed and as my understanding grew.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
I would say my approach to development became more about checking object placements if I'm being honest, not being able to see where the object will be in real
time was probably the most time-consuming part and the thing that ended up taking the most thought later on once I had the creation of objects down.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I think the fundamentals of rendering, texturing, and how light works in 3D rendering can all be applied to future education should any classes be at all
involved with that.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Similar to the above, I think it all applies well, especially so if my future career involves the topic.
